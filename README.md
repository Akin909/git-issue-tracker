# git-issue-tracker

Aim is to create a PWA written in ReasonML to Track Issues relating to a selected repo.
The primary focus is going to be on an offline first experience so hope setting up polling and caching for updates
Rendering markdown so codeblocks are legible, and much more once I figure out exactly what I want.

Also it's a learning exercise to get a bit of experience with ReasonML
